Today I learned how to create if else statements in order to return alerts to prompts. Also, I learned how to put css and jscript elements in their own page and link them to the html doc. Lastly, we went over github and git, and how to clone and acp files.

## Lab 3

After spending the first 3 days at Code Fellows, I've been able to draw upon memories of days that I've worked harder than I had to in order to make a living with a smile on my face. Since I was young, my family was always about hard work and effort. I brought those values with me into life and that's how I made decisions on what I thought would be most rewarding. I've always sought out the more complicated, difficult path in life because I like the challenge. I also had a lot of fun on the way too. I think the combination of choosing difficult pursuits along with having a good attitude about it has helped shape my character into a more capable person.

## Lab 4

My motivations for learning are clear and strong to me. Do develop skills that I can use to better myself and the lives around me. I've spent too many hours working tough jobs that don't pay for the skill, time, and work that they took and that is what drives me to keep learning and striving to achieve my accademic goals- so that I don't have to go back to the life that is no longer serving me. To move forward into a better life!

## Lab 5

Today felt like a big step in my learning process. Things we learned earlier are starting to make sense! I'm starting to grasp the functions concept, which felt like it broke my brain at first. As to why I want to learn coding, is almost the same as yesterday's answer; to better my life and the lives around me. Even though I could pick a million things to try to learn and probably enjoy, I chose the tech route because it seems to align with my interests, hobbies, and lifestyle.
