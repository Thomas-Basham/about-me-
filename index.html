  Hello, my name is Thomas! My friend's call me Tommy, and old people call me Tom. I have no kids, but I do have the sweetest Labrador companion named Lilah. I was born in Big Bear, California where I lived for just a wee bit until I moved to Yakima, WA when I was 4. I've always had a wild creative energy inside me and couldn't figure out exactly what I wanted to be when I grow up, so I joined the Army where I served for 4 years as a Cavalry Scout. Getting out of the Army, I fell back onto what I've always loved doing: Creating things. I've spent the past 7 years bouncing between school, work, and traveling. In 2020 I went to school in LA for music production at an awesome school called Icon Collective. Going to that school transformed my life, however there is still so much more I want to learn, which is why I am now here at Codefellows!

My greatest passion is writing and producing music. I love all things music! I can listen to and vibe with almost all genres, but the music I make is Pop and EDM. My favorite thing to do with friends is going to music festivals.  There isn’t a music festival I won’t go to, which is why I made this list.
