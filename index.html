    Hello, my name is Thomas! My friend's call me Tommy, and old people call me Tom. I was born in Big Bear, California where I lived for just a wee bit until I moved to Yakima, WA when I was 4. I've always had a wild creative energy inside me and couldn't figure out exactlty what I wanted to be when I grow up, so I joined the Army where I served for 4 years as a Cavalry Scout. Getting out of the Army, I fell back onto what I've always loved doing: Creating things. I've spent the past 7 years bouncing between school, work, and traveling. In 2020 I went to school in LA for music production at an awesome school called Icon Collective. Going to that school transformed my life, however there is still so much more I want to learn, which is why I am now here at Codefellows!
